#Make sure to modify the "add-MpPreference" lines for this script prior to running it. Otherwise the exceptions won't work.

#You will likely need to modify Execution Policy, the most simple way is to type the following before running the script:

Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process

#Run the script in an elevated powershell instance.
